# Optimization-Of-Triple-DES


About Project:-

Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm is a private key encryption technique. As time went on,with the evolution of technology there were various attacks like Brute force to decrypt the ciphertext, therefore limiting the usage of DES. To overcome such attacks Triple Data Encryption Standard (Triple-DES) was brought into place. Triple—DES employs the DES cipher three times Encryption-Decryption-Encryption. But even the Triple-DES has its own shortcomings. Therefore, a strategy must be devised to make the keys more reliable and avoid the ununiforrned nature of the power traces to make it more difﬁcult for the attackers.

The FORTIS algorithm aims at adding some enhancements to the existing Triple DES algorithm. Three blocks are added namely-Comparator, Versatile Left Shifter and Versatile Right Shifter. The versatile shiﬁers are used for dynamic shiﬁin g. The FORTIS algorithm results in better security along with a power trace diagram that is uniform throughout the process and therefore makes it difficult for the attackers to identify the speciﬁc process being carried out.
